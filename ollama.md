**What is ollama?**

Ollama is a free, open-source tool that simplifies running powerful, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 directly on your own computer (local machine) for macOS, Windows, and Linux, offering privacy, speed, and offline use by bundling models for easy setup and an API for integration. Think of it as a "Docker for LLMs," making AI accessible for development, experimentation, and private use without complex cloud setups.
